ObjectiveEveryTrail is an Objective-C framework that makes it easy for a Cocoa application to work with the [EveryTrail API](http://devwiki.everytrail.com).

This project is based off the [objectiveflickr](http://code.google.com/p/objectiveflickr/) project by Lukhnos D. Liu. Most of the credit goes to him!

Please refer to the [objectiveflickr](http://code.google.com/p/objectiveflickr/) for framework documentation and to the everytrail.com web site for [API documentation](http://devwiki.everytrail.com).

ObjectiveEveryTrail is used by [HoudahGeo (Mac photo geocoding)](http://www.houdah.com/houdahGeo) 2.6 and later.
